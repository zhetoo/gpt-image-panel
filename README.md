## Overview

GPT Image Panel is a lightweight web UI for image generation, image editing, gallery management, and local persistence. It connects to an external GPT-compatible image API and stores images plus metadata on your own server.

This project is only a self-hosted control panel. It does not provide, proxy, resell, or modify any upstream model/API service. Generation capability, billing, account permissions, content policy, and model behavior all come from the upstream provider you configure.

## Features

- Image generation through `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/responses`, or OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`.
- Image editing through `/v1/images/edits`, including uploaded references and gallery-source edits.
- API presets with base URL/path/key, default model, response format, health checks, SOCKS5 proxy, webhook, and env-ref secret support.
- Web-managed Overall Config for selected runtime settings, with env/default/override sources and restart/build-only badges.
- Prompt helper tags, reusable prompt snippets, optional server-side prompt optimizer, and an AI Assistant subsystem for prompt rewrites/checks/variants, parameter recommendations, job diagnosis, edit planning, and gallery image analysis.
- SQLite-backed job queue with SSE progress, cancellation, retry/reuse, persisted history, stage timing metadata, and shared generation/edit concurrency limits.
- Optional streaming partial-image preview for single-image `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` requests, delivered over SSE as the upstream generates. Job history shows per-job token usage and an estimated USD cost whenever the upstream reports `usage` for a model with a configured rate.
- Local gallery with cursor pagination, search/filtering, favorites, lightbox navigation, selection-token batch actions, ZIP import/export, thumbnails, byte-size metadata, and async export/import jobs.
- Optional Cloudflare R2 gallery backup sync; local SQLite/images remain the source of truth.
- Access-key gate, IP/Host allowlists, trusted proxy-header support, CSRF origin checks, CSP nonce injection, version checks, and optional JSON/Prometheus metrics.

## Architecture

- Backend: FastAPI under `backend/app/`; ASGI entrypoint is `backend.app.main:app`.
- Frontend: SvelteKit static app under `frontend/`; production backend serves `frontend/build/`.
- Runtime storage: generated images under `images/`, thumbnails under `images/thumbs/`, SQLite data under `data/app.sqlite3`, and logs under `data/logs/` by default.
- Multi-worker coordination: queued jobs, background leases, SSE slots, and scheduler ownership use SQLite leases. Image and thumbnail file writes/deletes use process-local locks only, and tolerate cross-process races through UUID filenames, atomic `Path.replace()`, and orphan-file GC TTL cleanup.
- Public API routing: `backend/app/api/contract_app.py`.
- DTOs: `backend/app/schemas/`.
- Persistence: `backend/app/repositories/`.
- Upstream API integration: `backend/app/integrations/`.
- Runtime config: `backend/app/core/settings.py`, `backend/app/core/overall_config.py`, `.env.example`, and `docker-compose.yml`.

```

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set ACCESS_KEY and any default upstream API values you want
# this example uses plain HTTP on loopback, so disable Secure cookies
ACCESS_COOKIE_SECURE=false docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:9090`.

This local HTTP example requires `ACCESS_COOKIE_SECURE=false`; keep it `true` when serving the panel over HTTPS. By default, `ACCESS_KEY` is required. For local-only testing, unset `ACCESS_KEY` and set `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true`; this makes every non-health API route accessible. To additionally protect the unlock flow with Cloudflare Turnstile, set `TURNSTILE_ENABLED=true` plus your `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` / `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` from the Cloudflare dashboard; the verification widget then appears below the Unlock button and a valid token is required for every access-key login.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t gpt-image-panel .
docker run -d --name gpt-image-panel \
  -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 \
  -e ACCESS_KEY=change-me \
  -e ACCESS_COOKIE_SECURE=false \
  -v $(pwd)/images:/app/images \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  gpt-image-panel
```

If Docker Hub is slow or blocked:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE=docker.m.daocloud.io/library/python:3.12-slim \
  --build-arg NODE_BASE_IMAGE=docker.m.daocloud.io/library/node:24-alpine \
  -t gpt-image-panel .
```

The image installs Python dependencies from the hashed `requirements.lock` (generated from `requirements.txt` with `uv pip compile`), so every build and both architectures get identical versions.

### Caddy Reverse Proxy

When Caddy and the application run on the same host, use a placeholder hostname and keep port `9090` bound to loopback:

```caddyfile
panel.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9090
}
```

For an HTTPS deployment, set the matching application origin and Host allowlist in `.env`:

```dotenv
PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://panel.example.com
ALLOWED_HOSTS=panel.example.com
ACCESS_COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

The basic proxy is recommended when there is only one upstream. If active health checks are required, first confirm that `/health` returns `200` with the same `Host` header, then use the plural `health_headers` block:

```bash
curl -i -H 'Host: panel.example.com' http://127.0.0.1:9090/health
```

```caddyfile
panel.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9090 {
        health_uri /health
        health_interval 15s
        health_timeout 3s
        health_status 200

        health_headers {
            Host panel.example.com
        }
    }
}
```

A health-check response outside the configured status range marks the upstream unhealthy. With only one upstream, this can make requests fail until the check succeeds again. Validate and reload Caddy after changes:

```bash
sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

Caddy automatic HTTPS requires the hostname to resolve to the server and inbound ports `80` and `443` to be reachable. When using a CDN proxy such as Cloudflare, ensure its edge certificate explicitly covers the complete hostname, especially for multi-label subdomains; otherwise browsers may report `ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH` before traffic reaches Caddy. If Caddy runs in a container, `127.0.0.1` refers to that container, so use the application service name or another reachable container-network address instead.

### Deployment Troubleshooting

1. **Container exits on startup with `SecretRegistryError: credentials require a non-empty startup host allowlist`**
   - **Cause**: `DEFAULT_API_KEY` is configured in `.env`, but `UPSTREAM_HOST_ALLOWLIST` is missing or empty.
   - **Fix**: Add the raw hostname of `DEFAULT_API_URL` to `UPSTREAM_HOST_ALLOWLIST` in `.env` (e.g. `UPSTREAM_HOST_ALLOWLIST=api.openai.com` or `UPSTREAM_HOST_ALLOWLIST=cf.api.fan`).
2. **Browser reports `400 Bad Request: Host is not allowed`**
   - **Cause**: The incoming `Host` header does not match `ALLOWED_HOSTS` or `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` in `.env` (often due to domain typos or failing to recreate the container after editing `.env`).
   - **Fix**: Ensure `PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://panel.example.com` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS=panel.example.com` match the exact domain. Always run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate` after modifying `.env`.
3. **Cannot log in or login loop under direct plain HTTP (no reverse proxy/SSL)**
   - **Cause**: By default `ACCESS_COOKIE_SECURE=true` requires HTTPS; browsers reject storing or sending `Secure` cookies over plain HTTP.
   - **Fix**: For direct HTTP testing, set `ACCESS_COOKIE_SECURE=false` in `.env`. Switch back to `true` once behind an HTTPS reverse proxy.
4. **Clicking "Save Preset" in Web UI fails or drawer does not close**
   - **Cause**:
     - Saving literal plaintext API keys to SQLite via the UI is prohibited by default. Set `ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_SECRETS=true` in `.env` and restart the container if you need to paste raw API keys directly into Web Settings.
     - If the preset API URL was modified, ensure its domain is also included in `UPSTREAM_HOST_ALLOWLIST`.

### Local Development

Create a project-local Python 3.11+ virtual environment first. The `.venv` directory is local developer state and is not provided by the repository.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt
pnpm --dir frontend install
pnpm run backend:dev
```

In another terminal:

```bash
pnpm run frontend:dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. Vite proxies `/api` and `/health` to FastAPI at `127.0.0.1:9090`.
Set `VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET=https://panel.example.com` when the local frontend needs to use a remote backend during development.

Production-style local smoke test:

```bash
pnpm run frontend:build
ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true .venv/bin/granian --interface asgi backend.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9090
```

## Configuration

Most runtime options live in `.env.example`. API presets, prompt optimizer, R2 backup, and selected app/runtime options can also be managed through Web Settings / Overall Config. Important variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ACCESS_KEY` | Access gate key. Required unless it is unset and `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true`. |
| `ACCESS_KEY_SESSION_MINUTES` | Access session lifetime in minutes; defaults to `10080` (7 days). |
| `TURNSTILE_ENABLED` / `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` / `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | Optional Cloudflare Turnstile human verification on the access gate. When enabled, unlocking requires a valid Turnstile token in addition to `ACCESS_KEY`; the site key is exposed via `/api/access/status` for the login widget. |
| `DEFAULT_API_URL` | Default upstream API base URL; may omit or include `/v1`. |
| `DEFAULT_API_KEY` | Default upstream API key. Prefer env refs such as `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` in Web Settings. |
| `DEFAULT_API_PATH` | `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/responses`, or `/v1/chat/completions`. |
| `DEFAULT_RESPONSES_MODEL` | Fallback model for `/v1/responses` when no request/preset model is provided. |
| `AIOHTTP_CONNECTION_LIMIT` / `AIOHTTP_CONNECTION_LIMIT_PER_HOST` | Shared aiohttp connector limits for upstream/probe/download calls. |
| `APP_VERSION` / `GITHUB_REPO` / `ENABLE_VERSION_CHECK` | UI/API version reporting and latest-release checks. |
| `VERSION_CHECK_CACHE_SECONDS` | Per-process cache TTL for successful latest-release checks. |
| `MAX_UPSTREAM_IMAGE_BYTES_PER_TASK_MB` / `UPSTREAM_MEMORY_BUDGET_MB` | Per-task decoded-image cap and process-local weighted upstream-memory admission budget. |
| `DB_EXECUTOR_WORKERS` / `SQLITE_BUSY_*` / `SQLITE_CRITICAL_BUSY_*` / `SQLITE_SLOW_TXN_WARN_MS` | Dedicated SQLite executor size and jittered retry controls. `DB_EXECUTOR_WORKERS` defaults to `max(4, MAX_ACTIVE_GENERATE_JOBS // 2 + 2)`. Polling reads use the short `SQLITE_BUSY_*` budget; claim, lease renewal, terminal unit writes, parent finalization and cancellation use the larger `SQLITE_CRITICAL_BUSY_*` budget so a transient lock cannot strand a running unit. Write transactions held longer than `SQLITE_SLOW_TXN_WARN_MS` are logged with their call label. |
| `IMAGE_CPU_CONCURRENCY` / `FILE_IO_CONCURRENCY` | Bounded full-image decode and blocking file-I/O concurrency per process. |
| `IMAGE_JOB_PROGRESS_PERSIST_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Minimum interval for coalesced image-unit progress writes. |
| `RUNTIME_METRICS_REFRESH_SECONDS` / `EVENT_LOOP_LAG_SAMPLE_SECONDS` | Background coordination snapshot and event-loop lag sampling intervals. |
| `MAX_ACTIVE_GENERATE_JOBS` | Global running generation/edit image-unit limit. Expired leases from crashed or unreachable workers do not count against it, so a dead worker cannot deadlock the queue; with healthy workers the effective limit stays at this value. |
| `GRANIAN_WORKERS` | Granian worker process count. Each process claims at most `ceil(MAX_ACTIVE_GENERATE_JOBS / GRANIAN_WORKERS)` image units so an `n>1` job is spread across workers instead of being monopolized by the worker that accepted the request. Set it equal to the actual process count. |
| `MAX_QUEUED_GENERATE_JOBS` | Queue capacity before new jobs return `429`. |
| `IMAGE_JOB_UNIT_LEASE_SECONDS` | SQLite claim lease for a running image unit. Crash-detection latency only — the executing worker renews the lease while upstream is in flight, so slow upstreams no longer lose their ownership. The upstream duration cap is still governed by the client timeout in `session_pool`. |
| `IMAGE_JOB_UNIT_LEASE_RENEW_SECONDS` | Cadence at which the executing worker extends an image-unit lease. Must stay below `lease/2` (defaults to `lease/3`); clamps to `lease/4` if misconfigured. A renewal that fails with a SQLite error is retried every 5s while the lease is still valid; only a renewal rejected by fencing (the unit was re-claimed or cancelled) aborts the in-flight upstream call immediately, so cancelling a job now stops its upstream request within one renewal interval. |
| `IMAGE_JOB_UNIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | Max claim attempts per image unit. A unit whose lease expires after its final attempt is marked `interrupted` instead of retried forever. |
| `IMAGE_UPSTREAM_MAX_ATTEMPTS` / `IMAGE_UPSTREAM_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` | Total attempts and linear backoff for retryable upstream image failures. Defaults to `3` attempts and `1` second. |
| `MAX_PENDING_EDIT_SOURCE_MB` | Global pending edit-source byte reservation cap. |
| `MAX_SSE_SUBSCRIBERS_GLOBAL` / `MAX_SSE_SUBSCRIBERS_PER_IP` / `SSE_CONNECTION_TTL_SECONDS` | SSE slot limits and max connection lifetime. |
| `IMAGES_DIR` | Saved image directory. |
| `THUMBNAILS_DIR` / `THUMBNAIL_*` | Gallery thumbnail storage and generation controls. |
| `DATA_DIR` / `DATABASE_FILE` | SQLite runtime storage. |
| `PROMPT_OPTIMIZER_*` | Optional server-side prompt optimizer settings. |
| `AI_ASSISTANT_*` | AI Assistant is enabled by default; set `AI_ASSISTANT_ENABLED=false` to disable it. API URL, key, text model, timeout, route, and host allowlist reuse `PROMPT_OPTIMIZER_*`. `AI_ASSISTANT_MAX_CONCURRENCY` caps concurrent upstream assistant calls and `AI_ASSISTANT_BATCH_MAX_IMAGES` caps one gallery AI batch. |
| `R2_*` | Optional Cloudflare R2 gallery backup sync settings; custom endpoint hosts require `R2_ENDPOINT_HOST_ALLOWLIST`. |
| `NODEIMAGE_API_KEY` | Optional NodeImage API key for server-side Gallery uploads. |
| `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` / `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Reverse-proxy Host/CSRF hardening. |
| `ENABLE_NGINX_ACCEL_REDIRECT` / `PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL` / `PUBLIC_THUMBNAIL_BASE_URL` | Optional nginx/CDN image byte serving behavior. |
| `GRANIAN_*` | Production runtime process/thread/static-asset tuning. |
| `ENABLE_METRICS` | Enables JSON/Prometheus metrics endpoints. |
| `LOG_DIR` / `LOG_LEVEL` / `LOG_RETENTION_HOURS` | Backend logs on stdout plus rotated files, retained for 24h by default. |

Secret fields prefer `${ENV_VAR_NAME}` references. Literal secrets stored in SQLite require `ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_SECRETS=true`.

Overall Config persists overrides in SQLite. Some settings are hot-reloaded; restart-required and build-only settings are marked in the UI and should still be changed through `.env`/Compose for reproducible deployments.

### Configuration precedence

Settings reach the process through three layers, and which one owns a name matters:

1. **Environment, read at import.** `backend/app/core/settings.py` reads every env var once into a module constant, and readers use those constants directly. Eight of them are *derived* from another setting (`MAX_UPSTREAM_IMAGE_BYTES_PER_TASK_MB`, `UPSTREAM_MEMORY_BUDGET_MB`, `MAX_PENDING_EDIT_SOURCE_MB`, `IMPORT_ARCHIVE_MAX_MB`, `IMPORT_TEMP_RESERVATION_MAX_MB`, `DB_EXECUTOR_WORKERS`, `AI_ASSISTANT_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `IMAGE_JOB_UNIT_LEASE_RENEW_SECONDS`): they follow their base value unless that name is itself set, and they are recomputed when a base changes at runtime.
2. **Overall Config overrides, in SQLite.** `/api/settings/overall-config` stores overrides in `overall_config_values`. Hot-reloadable keys take effect immediately; `restart_required` keys are stored and applied on the next start. `settings.apply_overrides` is the only code path that changes a setting after import, and it recomputes the derived values so the process cannot run with limits that contradict each other.
3. **Keys owned by `/api/settings`.** Names marked `exposed_in_settings` (API presets, prompt optimizer, AI assistant, R2, NodeImage) are read from SQLite first, with the environment value only seeding the default: after the first save from Web Settings, changing the matching env var has no effect.

Known limits: a runtime change to `DB_EXECUTOR_WORKERS`, `IMAGE_CPU_CONCURRENCY`, or `FILE_IO_CONCURRENCY` does not resize an already created thread pool, and each worker process keeps its own in-memory mirror of the API presets — those are re-read from SQLite for every job unit, so workers do not drift apart.

### SQLite write-lock and lease metrics

With `ENABLE_METRICS=true`, `/api/metrics` exposes the diagnostics used to size SQLite coordination:

- `sqlite.write_txn` — successful write transactions. On an idle process this should track the heartbeat and runtime-snapshot cadence, not per-second claim work; a flat rate confirms the idle claim prechecks (`image_jobs.claim_precheck_skipped` and the `gallery.*` / `thumbnail.*` variants) are skipping empty `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` cycles.
- `sqlite.write_lock_wait_ms` / `sqlite.write_txn_hold_ms` — `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` wait and full transaction hold (p50/p95/p99/max). Watch the p95 as `MAX_ACTIVE_GENERATE_JOBS x GRANIAN_WORKERS` grows; super-linear growth means contention scales faster than concurrency.
- `sqlite.busy` / `sqlite.busy_retries` — failed `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` attempts and retries. Critical writes consume the larger `SQLITE_CRITICAL_BUSY_*` budget before surfacing here.
- `image_jobs.lease_renewed` / `image_jobs.lease_lost` / `image_jobs.lease_renew_retry` — image-unit lease health. `lease_lost` should stay at zero; a non-zero rate means a unit was re-claimed or cancelled mid-flight (repeat-billing risk).
- `image_jobs.unit_reclaimed` / `image_jobs.unit_exhausted` — expired leases that were retried or marked `interrupted` after `IMAGE_JOB_UNIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`.
- `image_jobs.parent_write_skipped_terminal` — parent updates rejected because the job was already terminal (guards against state regression).

## Usage

1. Open the panel.
2. Unlock with `ACCESS_KEY` if enabled.
3. Open Settings.
4. Create or select an API preset.
5. Set API base URL, API path, model, response format, and API key/env ref.
6. Optionally configure SOCKS5 proxy, webhook, prompt optimizer, AI Assistant, R2 backup, NodeImage upload, or Overall Config overrides.
7. Save the preset and run its health check if needed.
8. Generate images from a prompt, or upload/select source images and run edits.
9. Use Gallery for reuse, filtering, favorites, batch actions, import/export, and R2 sync.

## GPT Image 2.5

The generation form and preset settings offer `gpt-image-2.5-flare` (fast everyday generation) and `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst` (precise editing). `gpt-image-2` remains the default; saved presets and custom model names are preserved. Choose **Custom model / snapshot** to pin either model to its `-2026-09-08` snapshot.

Use `/v1/images/generations` for generation. Uploading reference images or selecting a gallery image uses multipart `/v1/images/edits`. Both 2.5 variants support `auto`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` quality. Earlier/custom models retain the existing quality options. Selecting a model that does not support the current quality resets it to `auto`.

- Prompts support 32,000 Unicode characters across generation, editing, assistants and saved snippets. Prompt Optimizer defaults to the same character limit; an explicitly configured `PROMPT_OPTIMIZER_MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS` still takes precedence. Assistant engines retain their own token limits and report truncated upstream responses as errors.
- Size accepts `auto` or `WIDTHxHEIGHT`: both edges must be positive multiples of 16, neither may exceed 3840, aspect ratio must not exceed 3:1, and total pixels must be 655,360–8,294,400. Resolutions above 2560×1440 are experimental.
- Output formats are PNG, JPEG and WebP. Compression is sent only for JPEG/WebP (0–100, default 100). Transparent backgrounds require PNG/WebP; choosing transparency with JPEG switches output to PNG.
- 2.5 always returns Base64. The panel omits `response_format`, including values inherited from older presets, saves the image, and exposes its local image URL. Existing models and gateway modes keep their prior response-format behavior.
- This integration accepts up to 16 PNG/JPEG/WebP edit inputs, each smaller than 50 MB and subject to the configured upload limits. Convert other formats before editing. Requests for 1–10 outputs use the existing queue, one upstream image per unit.

GPT Image 2.5 is supported through the Images API here, including streaming preview (see below). The existing Responses gateway format, Chat Completions, and masks are not part of this integration. Model access depends on the upstream account. Higher quality settings can consume more tokens; equal token prices do not imply equal per-image costs between Flare and Sunburst.

API rules checked on 2026-09-10: [image generation guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/image-generation), [generation reference](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/images/methods/generate), [edit reference](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/images/methods/edit).

## Supported Upstream Paths

| Path | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `/v1/images/generations` | Standard image generation endpoint; reads image data from `data[]`. |
| `/v1/responses` | Sends `prompt` and `model`; reads base64 image data from `image_generation_call` output items. |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | Sends OpenAI-compatible chat completions requests; extracts image URLs/base64 data from messages or SSE chunks. |
| `/v1/images/edits` | Used by the Edits flow; sends multipart source images and supported edit params. |

For `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions`, size/quality/format/compression/quantity controls are disabled because those paths do not share the same parameter contract.

## Streaming Preview & Cost Estimation

- Streaming preview is opt-in per request (the "Streaming preview" toggle in the generation form), applies only to `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits`, and only with a quantity of 1 — each requested image is queued as a separate unit, so streaming and batching don't compose. Choose 1–3 preview frames; more frames mean more output tokens from the upstream and a somewhat higher cost for the same final image.
- If a compatible upstream advertises OpenAI-style support but rejects the `stream`/`partial_images` parameters, the job fails with a clear error asking you to disable streaming and retry — it never silently falls back to a second, non-streaming request, since that could double-bill the generation.
- Partial images are held only in server memory, one slot per running unit holding just the latest frame, bounded by `PREVIEW_CACHE_MAX_ENTRY_MB`/`PREVIEW_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` (see `.env.example`); they are never written to SQLite or the gallery. A client that reconnects mid-job gets whatever frame is still cached, or waits for the next one — a restarted or different worker process has nothing to replay.
- **Estimated cost is not a bill.** It is only computed from the `usage` object the upstream actually returns; when usage is missing, or the model has no configured price, the UI shows the reason (e.g. "no pricing configured for this model") instead of `$0.00`. The builtin rate table covers `gpt-image-1` and the GPT Image 2 / 2.5 model ids, taken from OpenAI's published Images API pricing — third-party "OpenAI-compatible" upstreams almost never match that pricing. Override or add per-model rates with `IMAGE_COST_RATES_JSON` in `.env.example`.

The public API surface is contract-tested; keep paths, methods, status codes, SSE event names, cookies, and response shapes stable unless a breaking change is intentional.

## Contributor Boundaries

- Keep browser calls same-origin through `/api/*`; do not add direct frontend calls to upstream model APIs, R2, webhook targets, or arbitrary image URLs.
- Keep ownership boundaries intact:
  - routers/request orchestration in `backend/app/api/routers/`
  - DTOs in `backend/app/schemas/`
  - persistence and SQLite coordination in `backend/app/repositories/`
  - upstream integrations in `backend/app/integrations/`
  - mirrored frontend API types in `frontend/src/lib/api/types.ts`
- Keep public contracts stable unless a breaking change is intentional:
  - API paths, methods, status codes, cookies, SSE event names, and response shapes
  - generation/edit queue lifecycle, cancellation semantics, and multi-worker SQLite coordination
  - file-system races are tolerated by UUID filenames, atomic replacement, and orphan GC; do not rely on process-local locks for cross-worker exclusion
- Keep validation and safety centralized:
  - image byte validation, safe paths, thumbnail/archive helpers
  - SSRF-sensitive URL handling in validators, safe connector, and integration clients
  - secrets exposed to the frontend only as masked values or env-ref metadata
- Preserve current runtime constraints:
  - edits accept up to 16 raster source images
  - gallery ZIP import/export keeps existing safety limits
  - SSE uses SQLite slot leases with global/per-IP caps and TTL
  - R2 sync is backup-only; local SQLite rows and local image files remain the source of truth
- When changing environment variables, update `backend/app/core/settings.py`, `backend/app/core/overall_config.py` when user-visible, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml` when configurable in Compose, and this README.
- Do not commit runtime/generated artifacts such as `images/`, `data/`, `frontend/build/`, `.svelte-kit/`, Playwright reports, test results, dependency folders, local DB files, or logs.

## Testing

Activate the project-local `.venv` before running backend or contract tests. The pnpm contract/performance scripts use `.venv/bin/python`.

```bash
pnpm run frontend:check
pnpm run frontend:build
.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests -q
pnpm run test:contract
pnpm run test:e2e
pnpm run test:perf
pnpm run test:e2e:perf
```

Run the focused subset relevant to your change. For release-bound or broad changes, run all of them.

The E2E configuration uses the system Google Chrome channel; it does not download or require a Playwright-managed browser.

## Contributing

For implementation boundaries and contributor-facing invariants, follow the `Contributor Boundaries` section above. Run the smallest relevant validation set for your change, and keep README/config updates in the same patch when behavior or environment variables change.
